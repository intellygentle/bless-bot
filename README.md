3. Install the necessary dependencies:

	```

## Usage
1. Register to blockless bless network account first, if you dont have you can register [https://bless.network/](https://bless.network/dashboard?ref=FZABS8).
2. Set and Modify `user.txt`. Below how to setup this file, put your B7S_AUTH_TOKEN in the text file, example below:
	```
	eyJhbGcixxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
	```
	To get your token, follow this step:
	- Login to your blockless account in [https://bless.network/](https://bless.network/dashboard?ref=FZABS8), 
	- Go to inspect element, press F12 or right-click then pick inspect element in your browser
	- Go to application tab - look for Local Storage in storage list -> click `https://bless.network` and you will see your B7S_AUTH_TOKEN.
	- or you can go Console tab and paste this 
	```bash
	localStorage.getItem('B7S_AUTH_TOKEN')
	```
3. Create hardware id
- you can automatically create it with this command
    ```
    node setup.js
    ```
	put in `id.txt`. in the text file with this format `nodeid(pubkey):hardwareid`, example below:
	```
 	12D3Koxxxxxxxxxxxx3ws:e938610xxxxxxxxxxxx
	12D3Koxxxxxxxxxxxx58o:221610xxxxxxxxxxxxx
 	```
4. put your pubkey you get from extension
	```bash
	nano id.txt
	```

5. If you want to use `proxy`, edit `proxy.txt` and add your proxy in there. Make sure total proxy is same with your total `nodeid(pubkey):hardwareid` that you put in `id.txt` 
6. Run the script:
	```bash
	node main.js
	```
**NOTE: The total time is refreshed every 10minute connection, One account only can have 5 nodeid max and can't be deleted, I recomended to save your Nodeid(pubkey) and hardwareid of your account**
